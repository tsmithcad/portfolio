                        <h3 class="lead">MVP Solution</h3>
                        <p>I built a special tool called a "Formed Metal Shape Configurator" that will help CAD Drafters at the Salt Lake City (SLC) airport. This tool will make it easier for them to select different options for a Column Cover, which is a protective covering for columns in buildings. Since every project is unique, this configurator will allow them to customize the Column Cover based on specific requirements and preferences. With this tool, CAD Drafters will be able to choose the desired shape, size, materials, and other features to create a customized Column Cover that perfectly fits the needs of the SLC airport.</p>

                        <small>Acceptance Criteria</small>

                        <p>To meet the acceptance criteria, it is crucial that the output code, models, drawings, documents, parameters, specifications, and file names are kept human-readable for both contributors and non-technical users. This means that the generated code should be well-structured, with clear and meaningful variable names, comments, and documentation. The models and drawings should be organized and labeled in a way that is easily understandable by anyone involved in the project, regardless of their technical background. Additionally, the parameters, specifications, and file names should be descriptive and intuitive, providing clear information about their purpose and content. By maintaining human-readable outputs, we ensure effective collaboration, smooth understanding, and seamless communication among all project stakeholders.</p>

                                By implementing the configurator, Fry Reglet achieved remarkable benefits, including substantial time savings, increased accuracy, improved efficiency, and seamless collaboration across departments. The manual tasks of creating quotes, specifications, 3D models, and engineering drawings were replaced with automated processes, resulting in accelerated engineering and manufacturing timelines, and faster production of customized items.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The configurator's automation and integration capabilities facilitated a streamlined and efficient Engineered to Order process, benefiting various teams such as CAD drafters, estimators, finance, project management, sales, manufacturing, and, most importantly, the customers. This technological advancement revolutionized the workflow and brought significant advantages to the entire organization.

                        <h3 class="lead">Project Challenges</h3>
                        <p class="card-body">Because CAD applications are highly GPU-intensive, rendering multiple models at scale can monopolize an engineer's running instance of Autodesk Inventor, rendering it unavailable for other tasks until the configuration is complete. This can cause delays and hinder productivity as engineers are unable to work on concurrent projects or perform other essential duties. The resource-intensive nature of rendering large-scale models underscores the need for efficient optimization and allocation of computing resources to ensure smooth workflow and maximize productivity.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="lead">Scaled Solution</h3>
                        <p class="card-body">With the assistance of a software development firm and the expertise of Sales Executive Daryl Price from D3 Technologies, we were able to scale the solution. Daryl Price proposed a solution that allowed engineers to configure a "simple" column cover using a fast web user interface (UI). Although this solution was inspired by the Column Cover configurator, it was not directly implemented for the Salt Lake City (SLC) airport Column Covers project. However, it provided valuable insights and contributed to the overall development and improvement of our configurator capabilities.

                                Under the guidance of Solution Architect Chris Rogers from D3 Technologies, I was able to provision an on-premise server and set up a development environment. With Chris's expertise, I also installed Autodesk Inventor and configured a rules engine that could consume the configuration JSON. Additionally, we developed a script that would continuously poll for incoming HTTP requests and trigger the Inventor API to start a "job" based on the provided configurations.
